<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a junior software engineer and experienced language and coding and robotics teacher.
  <br /> My primary backend, tech stacks include Python, Java and SQL.</p>

<p> As a multi-facted individual, filled with drive and determination,
  I am constantly seeking new challenges <br/> and opportunities to
  to expand my knowledge and skills in order to thrive in the
  world of work. <br /> I am currently upskilling in web development, in pursuance of
  becoming a full-stack software developer.</p>

<p> After graduating from the University of the Western Cape, with a Bachelor's Degree <br />
  in Language and Life Orientation Education (Summa Cum Laude), I commenced my teaching career <br /> 
  in the private education sector, notably working at the ADvTECH Group, as an Intersen Phase <br />  
  Afrikaans FAL and Creative Arts educator until 2021. In January 2022, I took a sabbatical from teaching <br />  
  and made the decision to enroll into HyperionDev's software engineering bootcamp. Soon after the completion <br />  
  of my bootcamp in August, I was offered a position as a coding mentor at HyperionDev, offering mentorship <br /> 
  and technical support to both commercial and international coding students enrolled at the institution. <br /> 
  In December 2022, I started working as a freelance code reviewer for HyperionDev, having also started <br/>
  a consultancy position as a Grade 7-9 Robotics and Coding teacher at Resolute Education - <br /> 
  a position I held for 4 months.</p>

<p> I am currently employed at Curro Holdings, where I work as a Primary School Coding and Robotics, and 
  <br/>Technology Teacher at Meridian Pinehurst.</p>

<p> Beyond my teaching and software engineering career, I enjoy spending my free time with family and friends.
  <br /> I also enjoy reading, watching movies, spending time outdoors and, more importantly, 
  <br /> doing what I do best.  .  .CODING!</p>
